## Details what he does:
The script that I used to quickly search for free IPs when setting up switches. Later I added a search function for the IPs that were not added to Cacti but nevertheless installed somewhere. This script was the beginning of the project for semi-automatic switch settings.

If you want to run my parser, you will need to install requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
and write your data to the config.py
